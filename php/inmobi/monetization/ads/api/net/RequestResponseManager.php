/**
 * This class can be used to request InMobi Ads, by passing in a valid
 * Request object, and a ad format type. Please use this class to obtain the
 * response as a String. Please check the
 * <i>errorCode</i> value if in case an error has occurred, if the
 * response returned is invalid. This class makes use of the
 * java.net.HttpURLConnection, to request InMobi ads in a synchronous fashion.
 * Publishers may create new Threads themselves to fire http requests in an
 * asynchronous manner.
 * 
 * @note It is the publisher's responsibility to check if the request contains the
 *       mandatory required parameters. If the mandatory parameters are not
 *       present, our servers would terminate the request. <br/>
 *       We recommend converting Request to JsonObject using <b>
 *       JSONPayloadCreator</b>, so that any missing parameter can be
 *       identified.<br/>
 *       Publishers may also check 'isRequestInProgress' before calling any of
 *       request methods, to check if a request was in progress or not.
